      "description": "GSTN_offline_tool in India Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) Offline Utility tool before 1.2 executes winstart-server.vbs from the \"C:\\GST Offline Tool\" directory, which has insecure permissions. This allows local users to gain privileges by replacing winstart-server.vbs with arbitrary VBScript code. For example, a local user could create VBScript code for a TCP reverse shell, and use that later for Remote Command Execution.",
