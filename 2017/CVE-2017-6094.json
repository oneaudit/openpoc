      "description": "CPEs used by subscribers on the access network receive their individual configuration settings from a central GAPS instance. A CPE identifies itself by the MAC address of its WAN interface and a certain \"chk\" value (48bit) derived from the MAC. The algorithm used to compute the \"chk\" was disclosed by reverse engineering the CPE's firmware. As a result, it is possible to forge valid \"chk\" values for any given MAC address and therefore receive the configuration settings of other subscribers' CPEs. The configuration settings often contain sensitive values, for example credentials (username/password) for VoIP services. This issue affects Genexis B.V. GAPS up to 7.2.",
