      "description": "The iOS mobile application BlueCats Reveal before 5.14 stores the username and password in the app cache as base64 encoded strings, i.e. clear text. These persist in the cache even if the user logs out. This can allow an attacker to compromise the affected BlueCats network implementation. The attacker would first need to gain physical control of the iOS device or compromise it with a malicious app.",
