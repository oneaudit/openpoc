A user is allowed to send an archive of their chat log to an email address specified at the beginning of the chat (where the user enters in their name and e-mail address). This POST request can be modified to change the message as well as the end recipient of the message. The e-mail address will have the same domain name and user as the product allotted. This can be used in phishing campaigns against users on the same domain.",
