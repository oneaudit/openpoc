      "description": "Comodo Antivirus versions up to 12.0.0.6810 are vulnerable to a local Denial of Service affecting CmdVirth.exe via its LPC port \"cmdvrtLPCServerPort\". A low privileged local process can connect to this port and send an LPC_DATAGRAM, which triggers an Access Violation due to hardcoded NULLs used for Source parameter in a memcpy operation that is called for this handler. This results in CmdVirth.exe and its child svchost.exe instances to terminate.",
