      "description": "An unrestricted file upload vulnerability was discovered in catalog/productinfo/imageupload in Fecshop FecMall 2.3.4. An attacker can bypass a front-end restriction and upload PHP code to the webserver, by providing image data and the image/jpeg content type, with a .php extension. This occurs because the code relies on the getimagesize function.",
