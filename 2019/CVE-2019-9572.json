      "description": "SchoolCMS version 2.3.1 allows file upload via the theme upload feature at admin.php?m=admin\u0026c=theme\u0026a=upload by using the .zip extension along with the _Static substring, changing the Content-Type to application/zip, and placing PHP code after the ZIP header. This ultimately allows execution of arbitrary PHP code in Public\\Home\\1_Static.php because of mishandling in the Application\\Admin\\Controller\\ThemeController.class.php Upload() function.",
