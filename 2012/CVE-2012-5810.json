      "description": "The Chase mobile banking application for Android does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate, related to overriding the default X509TrustManager. NOTE: this vulnerability was fixed in the summer of 2012, but the version number was not changed or is not known.",
