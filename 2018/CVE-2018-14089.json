      "description": "An issue was discovered in a smart contract implementation for Virgo_ZodiacToken, an Ethereum token. In this contract, 'bool sufficientAllowance = allowance \u003c= _value' will cause an arbitrary transfer in the function transferFrom because '\u003c=' is used instead of '\u003e=' (which was intended). An attacker can transfer from any address to his address, and does not need to meet the 'allowance \u003e value' condition.",
