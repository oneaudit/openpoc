      "description": "LogicalDoc before 8.3.3 could allow an attacker to upload arbitrary files, leading to command execution or retrieval of data from the database. LogicalDoc provides a functionality to add documents. Those documents could then be used for multiple tasks, such as version control, shared among users, applying tags, etc. This functionality could be abused by an unauthenticated attacker to upload an arbitrary file in a restricted folder. This would lead to the executions of malicious commands with root privileges.",
