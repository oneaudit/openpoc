      "description": "An issue was discovered in Gurux GXDLMS Director through 8.5.1905.1301. When downloading OBIS codes, it does not verify that the downloaded files are actual OBIS codes and doesn't check for path traversal. This allows the attacker exploiting CVE-2020-8809 to send executable files and place them in an autorun directory, or to place DLLs inside the existing GXDLMS Director installation (run on next execution of GXDLMS Director). This can be used to achieve code execution even if the user doesn't have any add-ins installed.",
