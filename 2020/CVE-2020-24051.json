      "description": "The Moog EXO Series EXVF5C-2 and EXVP7C2-3 units support the ONVIF interoperability IP-based physical security protocol, which requires authentication for some of its operations.

An attacker can abuse this issue to execute privileged operations without authentication, for instance, to create a new Administrator user.",
