It has been identified that the smart band has no pairing (mode 0 Bluetooth LE security level) The data being transmitted over the air is not encrypted. Adding to this, the data being sent to the smart band doesn't have any authentication or signature verification. Thus, any attacker can control a parameter of the device.",
