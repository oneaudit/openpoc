      "description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the JPEG2000 Stripe Decoding functionality of Nitro Software, Inc.â€™s Nitro Pro 13.13.2.242 when decoding sub-samples. While initializing tiles with sub-sample data, the application can miscalculate a pointer for the stripes in the tile which allow for the decoder to write out of-bounds and cause memory corruption. This can result in code execution. A specially crafted image can be embedded inside a PDF and loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.",
