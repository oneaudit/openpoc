An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a target system to stop responding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send specially crafted ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets to a remote Windows computer. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows TCP/IP stack handles ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
