      "description": "An issue was discovered in Epikur before 20.1.1. It stores the secret passwords of the users as MD5 hashes in the database. MD5 can be brute-forced efficiently and should not be used for such purposes. Additionally, since no salt is used, rainbow tables can speed up the attack.",
