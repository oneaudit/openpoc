      "description": "The JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.4 through 2.4.9, 2.5 through 2.5.7, and 2.6 through 2.6.5, has an Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability. This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.",
