      "description": "LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the \"Capture Debug Information\" page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the \"hostname\" parameter when creating a new device. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when the \"Capture Debug Information\" page is visited, redirecting the user and sending non-httponly cookies to an attacker-controlled domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.",
