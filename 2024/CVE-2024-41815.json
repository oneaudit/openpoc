      "description": "Starship is a cross-shell prompt. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to version 1.20.0, undocumented and unpredictable shell expansion and/or quoting rules make it easily to accidentally cause shell injection when using custom commands with starship in bash. This issue only affects users with custom commands, so the scope is limited, and without knowledge of others' commands, it could be hard to successfully target someone. Version 1.20.0 fixes the vulnerability.",
