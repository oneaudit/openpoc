The manipulation of the argument Brand Name leads to cross site scripting. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory mentions the parameter \"phone_number\" to be affected. But this might be a mistake because the textbox field label is \"Brand Name\".",
