      "description": "A CSV injection vulnerability in Automation Anywhere Automation 360 version 21094 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload. NOTE: Automation Anywhere disputes this report, arguing the attacker executes everything from the client side and does not attack the Control Room. The payload is being injected in the http Response from the client-side, so the owner of the Response and payload is the end user in this case. They contend that the server's security controls have no impact or role to play in this situation and therefore this is not a valid vulnerability.",
