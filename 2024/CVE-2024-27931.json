      "description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. Insufficient validation of parameters in `Deno.makeTemp*` APIs would allow for creation of files outside of the allowed directories. This may allow the user to overwrite important files on the system that may affect other systems. A user may provide a prefix or suffix to a `Deno.makeTemp*` API containing path traversal characters. This is fixed in Deno 1.41.1.\n\n",
