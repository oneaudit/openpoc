      "description": "lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to a session reuse attack, allowing a removed user to change the organization name without proper authorization. The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation to check if a user is still part of an organization before allowing them to make changes. An attacker can exploit this by using an old authorization token to send a PATCH request, modifying the organization's name even after being removed from the organization. This issue is due to incorrect synchronization and affects the orgs.patch route.",
