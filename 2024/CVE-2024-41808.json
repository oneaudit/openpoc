      "description": "The OpenObserve open-source observability platform provides the ability to filter logs in a dashboard by the values uploaded in a given log. However, all versions of the platform through 0.9.1 do not sanitize user input in the filter selection menu, which may result in complete account takeover. It has been noted that the front-end uses `DOMPurify` or Vue templating to escape cross-site scripting (XSS) extensively, however certain areas of the front end lack this XSS protection. When combining the missing protection with the insecure authentication handling that the front-end uses, a malicious user may be able to take over any victim's account provided they meet the exploitation steps. As of time of publication, no patched version is available.",
