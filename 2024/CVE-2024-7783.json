      "description": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm version latest contains a vulnerability where sensitive information, specifically a password, is improperly stored within a JWT (JSON Web Token) used as a bearer token in single user mode. When decoded, the JWT reveals the password in plaintext. This improper storage of sensitive information poses significant security risks, as an attacker who gains access to the JWT can easily decode it and retrieve the password. The issue is fixed in version 1.0.3.",
