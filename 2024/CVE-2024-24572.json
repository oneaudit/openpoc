      "description": "facileManager is a modular suite of web apps built with the sysadmin in mind. In versions 4.5.0 and earlier, the $_REQUEST global array was unsafely called inside an extract() function in admin-logs.php. The PHP file fm-init.php prevents arbitrary manipulation of $_SESSION via the GET/POST parameters. However, it does not prevent manipulation of any other sensitive variables such as $search_sql. Knowing this, an authenticated user with privileges to view site logs can manipulate the search_sql\nvariable by appending a GET parameter search_sql in the URL. The information above means that the checks and SQL injection prevention attempts were rendered unusable.",
