      "description": "In Ubuntu's trust-store, if a user revokes location access from an application, the location is still available to the application because the application will honour incorrect, cached permissions. This is because the cache was not ordered by creation time by the Select struct in src/core/trust/impl/sqlite3/store.cpp. Fixed in trust-store (Ubuntu) version 1.1.0+15.04.20150123-0ubuntu1 and trust-store (Ubuntu RTM) version 1.1.0+15.04.20150123~rtm-0ubuntu1.",
