      "description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a blocking operation when a task is in !TASK_RUNNING. In dvb_frontend_get_event, wait_event_interruptible is called; the condition is dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events). In dvb_frontend_test_event, down(\u0026fepriv-\u003esem) is called. However, wait_event_interruptible would put the process to sleep, and down(\u0026fepriv-\u003esem) may block the process.",
