      "description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 14.3-rc-1, `org.xwiki.store.script.TemporaryAttachmentsScriptService#uploadTemporaryAttachment` returns an instance of `com.xpn.xwiki.doc.XWikiAttachment`. This class is not supported to be exposed to users without the `programing` right. `com.xpn.xwiki.api.Attachment` should be used instead and takes case of checking the user's rights before performing dangerous operations. This has been patched in versions 14.9-rc-1 and 14.4.6. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
