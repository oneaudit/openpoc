      "description": "Tuleap is an open source suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration. In Tuleap Community Edition prior to version 14.11.99.28 and Tuleap Enterprise Edition prior to versions 14.10-6 and 14.11-3, content displayed in the \"card fields\" (visible in the kanban and PV2 apps) is not properly escaped. An agile dashboard administrator deleting a kanban with a malicious label can be forced to execute uncontrolled code. Tuleap Community Edition 14.11.99.28, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.10-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.11-3 contain a fix for this issue.",
