      "description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. The fix applied for CVE-2023-39515 in version 1.2.25 is incomplete as it enables an adversary to have a victim browser execute malicious code when a victim user hovers their mouse over the malicious data source path in `data_debug.php`. To perform the cross-site scripting attack, the adversary needs to be an authorized cacti user with the following permissions: `General Administration\u003eSites/Devices/Data`. The victim of this attack could be any account with permissions to view `http://\u003cHOST\u003e/cacti/data_debug.php`. As of time of publication, no complete fix has been included in Cacti.",
