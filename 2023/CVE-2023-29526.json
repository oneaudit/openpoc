In affected versions it's possible to display or interact with any page a user cannot access through the combination of the async and display macros.

This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.3, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
