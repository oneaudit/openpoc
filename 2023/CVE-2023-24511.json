      "description": "On affected platforms running Arista EOS with SNMP configured, a specially crafted packet can cause a memory leak in the snmpd process. This may result in the snmpd processing being terminated (causing SNMP requests to time out until snmpd is automatically restarted) and potential memory resource exhaustion for other processes on the switch. The vulnerability does not have any confidentiality or integrity impacts to the system.",
