A Blind Boolean SQL injection vulnerability within the order_by_for_ticket function in app/models/reporting/database_query.rb allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the sort parameter. This can be leveraged to leak local files from the host system, leading to remote code execution (RCE) through deserialization of malicious data.",
