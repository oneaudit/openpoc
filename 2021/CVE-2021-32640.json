      "description": "ws is an open source WebSocket client and server library for Node.js. A specially crafted value of the `Sec-Websocket-Protocol` header can be used to significantly slow down a ws server. The vulnerability has been fixed in ws@7.4.6 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/00c425ec77993773d823f018f64a5c44e17023ff). In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated by reducing the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_max_http_header_size_size) and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_options_requestlistener) options.",
