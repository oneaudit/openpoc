      "description": "iziModal is a modal plugin with jQuery. Versions prior to 1.6.1 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) when handling untrusted modal titles. An attacker who is able to influence the field `title` when creating a `iziModal` instance is able to supply arbitrary `html` or `javascript` code that will be rendered in the context of a user, potentially leading to `XSS`. Version 1.6.1 contains a patch for this issue",
