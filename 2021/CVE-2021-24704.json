      "description": "In the Orange Form WordPress plugin through 1.0, the process_bulk_action() function in \"admin/orange-form-email.php\" performs an unprepared SQL query with an unsanitized parameter ($id). Only admin can access the page that invokes the function, but because of lack of CSRF protection, it is actually exploitable and could allow attackers to make a logged in admin delete arbitrary posts for example",
