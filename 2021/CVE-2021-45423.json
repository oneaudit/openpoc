      "description": "A Buffer Overflow vulnerabilityexists in Pev 0.81 via the pe_exports function from exports.c.. The array offsets_to_Names is dynamically allocated on the stack using exp-\u003eNumberOfFunctions as its size. However, the loop uses exp-\u003eNumberOfNames to iterate over it and set its components value. Therefore, the loop code assumes that exp-\u003eNumberOfFunctions is greater than ordinal at each iteration. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
