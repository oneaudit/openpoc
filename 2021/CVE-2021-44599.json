      "description": "The id parameter from Online Enrollment Management System 1.0 system appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A crafted payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed. The attacker can retrieve sensitive information for all users of this system.",
