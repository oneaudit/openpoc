      "description": "The Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack before 6.1.2.1, 6.0.3.5 suffers from an open redirect vulnerability. Specially crafted `Host` headers in combination with certain \"allowed host\" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website. Impacted applications will have allowed hosts with a leading dot. When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially crafted `Host` header can be used to redirect to a malicious website.",
