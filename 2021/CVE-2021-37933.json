      "description": "An LDAP injection vulnerability in /account/login in Huntflow Enterprise before 3.10.6 could allow an unauthenticated, remote user to modify the logic of an LDAP query and bypass authentication. The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side validation of the email parameter before using it to construct LDAP queries. An attacker could bypass authentication exploiting this vulnerability by sending login attempts in which there is a valid password but a wildcard character in email parameter.",
