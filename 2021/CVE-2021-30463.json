      "description": "VestaCP through 0.9.8-24 allows attackers to gain privileges by creating symlinks to files for which they lack permissions. After reading the RKEY value from user.conf under the /usr/local/vesta/data/users/admin directory, the admin password can be changed via a /reset/?action=confirm\u0026user=admin\u0026code= URI. This occurs because chmod is used unsafely.",
