      "description": "The /device/signin end-point for the Ourphoto App version 1.4.1 discloses clear-text password information for functionality within the picture frame devices. The deviceVideoCallPassword and mqttPassword are returned in clear-text. The lack of sessions management and presence of insecure direct object references allows to return password information for other end-users devices. Many of the picture frame devices offer video calling, and it is likely this information can be used to abuse that functionality.",
