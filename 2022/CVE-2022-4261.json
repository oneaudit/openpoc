      "description": "Rapid7 Nexpose and InsightVM versions prior to 6.6.172 failed to reliably validate the authenticity of update contents. This failure could allow an attacker to provide a malicious update and alter the functionality of Rapid7 Nexpose. The attacker would need some pre-existing mechanism to provide a malicious update, either through a social engineering effort, privileged access to replace downloaded updates in transit, or by performing an Attacker-in-the-Middle attack on the update service itself.",
