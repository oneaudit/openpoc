      "description": "ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application The file parameter is vulnerable to a cross site scripting vulnerability (XSS) by backing out of the current \"tr\" \"td\" brackets. This then allows a malicious user to provide code that will execute when a user views the specific log on the \"view=log\" page. This vulnerability allows an attacker to store code within the logs that will be executed when loaded by a legitimate user. These actions will be performed with the permission of the victim. This could lead to data loss and/or further exploitation including account takeover. This issue has been addressed in versions `1.36.27` and `1.37.24`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable database logging.",
