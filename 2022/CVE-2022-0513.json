      "description": "The WP Statistics WordPress plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient escaping and parameterization of the exclusion_reason parameter found in the ~/includes/class-wp-statistics-exclusion.php file which allows attackers without authentication to inject arbitrary SQL queries to obtain sensitive information, in versions up to and including 13.1.4. This requires the \"Record Exclusions\" option to be enabled on the vulnerable site.",
