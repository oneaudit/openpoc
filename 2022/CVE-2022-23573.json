      "description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `AssignOp` can result in copying uninitialized data to a new tensor. This later results in undefined behavior. The implementation has a check that the left hand side of the assignment is initialized (to minimize number of allocations), but does not check that the right hand side is also initialized. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
