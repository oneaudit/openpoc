      "description": "The package dexie before 3.2.2, from 4.0.0-alpha.1 and before 4.0.0-alpha.3 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution in the Dexie.setByKeyPath(obj, keyPath, value) function which does not properly check the keys being set (like __proto__ or constructor). This can allow an attacker to add/modify properties of the Object.prototype leading to prototype pollution vulnerability. **Note:** This vulnerability can occur in multiple ways, for example when modifying a collection with untrusted user input.",
